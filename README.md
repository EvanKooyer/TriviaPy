# TriviaPy - Simple Trivia Project

This is a project that I started to work on to complete the project objective for a Codecademy career path I am working through.

## Project goals
- [x] Make a trivia game that pulls from an api. (open trivia DB)
- [x] Allow user to configure how many trivia questions there are.
- [x] Allow user to select from the list of categories that Open Trivia DB offers.
- [x] Learn textual to create an interactive TUI.
- [] Style the TUI (simple styling, but enough where I have to learn a little CSS).
- [] Refactor the code where it makes sense once I have a working application.
